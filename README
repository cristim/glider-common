This module contains some common stuff needed by the other modules.

I hope to keep this as small as possible so the bits implemented here can be 
merged back into the modules if they need to be used independently, making the 
other modules very close to being self-contained.

This software was written in 2010 by Cristian Măgherușan-Stanciu, as part of the MSc. thesis 
project at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

I hereby place all of it under the public domain, so feel free to use it for any purpose.

Still, I'd appreciate if you would give me any feedback, and patches are always welcome.

Thanks for using it, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
